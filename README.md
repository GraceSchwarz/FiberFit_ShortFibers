## Overview
FiberFit is a portable Python application for Mac and Windows. It uses computer vision to analyze 2-D 8-bit images. Code is hosted in a private repository on Bitbucket. The bulk of my work included making a Graphical User Interface (GUI) around an existing algorithm mentioned above. I used an Object-Oriented approach and built the application using the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.

## Features
* Processes multiple images
* Exports result of the analysis in PDF (utilizes open-source Python library) and csv
* Live progress bar, which updates user about status of the image analysis (utilizes threading)
