OVERVIEW:

FiberFit uses a fast Fourier transform to build fiber orientation distributions from two-dimensional images of fiber networks (.png, .jpeg). FiberFit uses a Von Mises distribution to calculate fiber dispersion k and preferred fiber orientation Î¼.  Results are exported in PDF and .csv formats.

TODO: Improve this.
